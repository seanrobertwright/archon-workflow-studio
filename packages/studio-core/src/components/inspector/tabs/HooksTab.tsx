/**
 * Shared base-field tab for per-node `hooks`. Drift §8 (user decision):
 * ship a JsonField, NOT the row-editor in the plan snippet.
 *
 * Why: actual schema is `Record<EventName, Array<{matcher?, response, timeout?}>>`
 * with 21 named events and structured JSON `response` (the SDK's
 * SyncHookJSONOutput, not a shell command). The plan's
 * `{event, match, command, blocking}[]` flat-row UI does not model this.
 * A real structured editor is Phase 8 polish; for Phase 4 ship the raw
 * JSON editor with the same forward-compat semantics as AdvancedTab.
