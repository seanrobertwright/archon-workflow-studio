/**
 * Deep-merge a patch onto a base value with two custom rules:
 *   - Arrays are REPLACED wholesale (lodash's default per-index merge would
 *     produce nonsense for fields like allowed_tools / disallowed_tools).
 *   - `null` in the patch DELETES the corresponding key (lets the inspector
 *     clear an optional field without a separate delete action).
 *
 * Used by `builder-store.updateNodeData`. The forward-compat invariant of §6.3
 * relies on this preserving keys the patch never mentions.
